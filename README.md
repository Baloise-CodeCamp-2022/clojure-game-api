# Comparing strategies

Use this to simulate a game of one strategy vs another:
```clojure
(defn trial [p1 v1 p2 v2 board]
  (let [newBoardWithStatus (apply p1 board v1 '())]
    ; (prn newBoardWithStatus)
    (if (= GAME_IN_PROGRESS (newBoardWithStatus :status))
      (trial p2 v2 p1 v1 (newBoardWithStatus :board))
      (newBoardWithStatus :status)
      )))
```
Call it like this:
```clojure
(trial cpuOpponent2 :X cpuOpponentRandomMoves :O {})
```
To simulate a lot of games and count results do this:
```clojure
(sort 
  (frequencies 
    (take 1000 (repeatedly #(trial cpuOpponent2 :X cpuOpponentRandomMoves :O {})))))
=> (["DRAW" 171] ["LOST" 24] ["WON" 805])
```
